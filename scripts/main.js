// Define a function that is responsible for making a piece of pottery.
const makePottery = () => {
  // make pottery here
  //
}

// The function should output an object that represents a piece of pottery.
// The object should describe its shape, weight, and height.

// FORM ##########
// The function should take all three of those properties as input to generate the object.

// The function should also add an id property to the object whose value is an integer, and each object should have a unique id value. Use a globally-scoped variable and increment it each time an object is created.
// Define a function that is responsible for acting as a kiln. It should take a pottery object as input and also the temperature of the kiln as input. It should add a new property of fired with the value of true to the object. It should output the pottery object.
// If the temperature of the kiln is above 2200 degrees then the pottery object should have a new property of cracked added to it, with a value of true.
// If the temperature of the kiln is below, or equal to, 2200 degrees then the pottery object should have a new property of cracked added to it, with a value of false.
// Define a function that is responsible for determining if a piece of pottery should be sold. Cracked pottery should not be sold, and non-cracked pottery should be sold.
// If the weight of the piece of pottery is over 3, then it should get a price property with a value of 40.
// If the weight is under 3, its price should be 20.
